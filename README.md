## Introduction

### Goals

The goal of the Evolution working group is to develop metrics to assess the lifecycle of the open source projects. 

### Purpose

Evolution is a working group focused on the lifecycle of open source projects. We do not valence the stages but seek to build awareness of those stages among consumers of these metrics. The decline can be ok when a project's utility is waning; or terrible if 20% of the entire internet relies on that project. Context matters, and we are not the arbiters of your context. The "valence" of "good/bad" emerges from use cases and YOUR context. 

### Who should join this working group?

All contributors are welcome to [participate](#participate) in the Evolution Working Group. The areas of interest include [Code Development Activity](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/focus-areas/code-development-activity), [Code Development Efficiency](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/focus-areas/code-development-efficiency), [Code Development Process Quality](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/focus-areas/code-development-process-quality), [Issue Resolution](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/focus-areas/issue-resolution), and [Community Growth](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/focus-areas/community-growth).

## Metrics

## Metrics Focus Areas

The evolution metrics dealt with in this working group are organized in focus areas:

Focus Area | Goal
--- | ---
[Code Development Activity](./focus-areas/tree/main/code-development-activity) | Learn about the types and frequency of activities involved in developing code.
[Code Development Efficiency](./focus-areas/tree/main/code-development-efficiency) | Learn how efficiently activities around code development get resolved.
[Code Development Process Quality](./tree/main/focus-areas/code-development-process-quality) | Learn about the processes to improve/review quality that are used (for example: testing, code review, tagging issues, tagging a release, time to response, CII Badging).
[Issue Resolution](./focus-areas/tree/main/issue-resolution) | Identify how effective the community is at addressing issues identified by community participants.
[Community Growth](./focus-areas/tree/main/community-growth) | Identify the size of the project community and whether it is growing, shrinking, or staying the same.

Please note that the work in the focus areas is still in progress.
